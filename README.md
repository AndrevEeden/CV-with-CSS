                <h3>Client Success</h3>
                <p>In my time working as a client success Manager I have learned to be focused on exceptional client
                    service and how to deal with a wide variety of clients.
                    I have reactivated clients that have stopped using the TecEx service.
                    I have grown the value that we are getting from existing clients and I have also ensured that newly
                    signed clients make use of our service in the first few months of signing.
                    All clients are different and you can't use a blanket approach for all of them.

                <h3>Website Development</h3>
                <p>I am currently busy with my first web development course.
                    I do believe that it is a hugely growing industry and that the potential in this industry is
                    endless.
                    I am considering doing as many online courses as possible in 2023 and then looking to enter the
                    software development industry in 2024.
                    This will be a very big leap as I will have to restart almost all my career progress, but it might
                    just be worth it!
